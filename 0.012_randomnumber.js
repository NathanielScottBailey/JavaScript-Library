//Javscript has a function that will give you a random number from 0-1

console.log(Math.random());

//To get a a number larger than 1, we have to multiply times a number
//always captalize math
console.log(Math.random()* 5)
//also we can set a minimum by adding the a number to this^^
console.log((Math.random()*5) +5)
