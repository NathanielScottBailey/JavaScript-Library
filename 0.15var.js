var cat = "brown"
//this was the norma way to write a variable
//which is a global variable, and very unsecure

//through the newest updates on js we can make several different variables

let dog = "white"

//^ the above variable only lets the key word dog to be defined in a scope

const rat= 'blue'

//const allows us to make a variable thats constant and cannot be changed
